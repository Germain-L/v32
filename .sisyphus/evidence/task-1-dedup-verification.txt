Task 1: Deduplication Verification
===================================

## Grep Results: Duplicate Method Detection

Searching for duplicate implementations in screen files...

Command: grep -rn "Color _ratingColor\|String _formatWater" lib/presentation/screens/

Result: No matches found

## Verification: Shared Helpers Import

All screen files now import from animation_helpers.dart:

1. today_screen.dart: ✓ imports animation_helpers.dart
2. day_detail_screen.dart: ✓ imports animation_helpers.dart
3. calendar_screen.dart: ✓ imports animation_helpers.dart

## Conclusion

All duplicate _ratingColor and _formatWater implementations have been
successfully removed from screen files. The shared helpers in
lib/utils/animation_helpers.dart are now the single source of truth.
